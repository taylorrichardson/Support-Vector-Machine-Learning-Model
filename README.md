# Support Vector Machine Learning Model

Taylor Richardson

December 12, 2018

I used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the test data points as either having a positive or negative outcome.

The outcome variable denoted a 0 if the student didn't perform better on the next test than on a previous test, and 1 if they did perform better than previously.

It showed the most effective method for a positive outcome variable was method 1.

The model itself is fairly inaccurate at only 50% roughly. 

This is likely due to the low amount of data to train and test on.
